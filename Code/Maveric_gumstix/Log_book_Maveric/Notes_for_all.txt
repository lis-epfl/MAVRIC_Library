Tuned the PID control parameters (using MAV09) to rev4 autopilot and new motors/frame. Reason: the old gains from rev3 were too high for the new motors and had to be reduced; however the initial reduction was too much and lead to worse stability (sluggish uprighting, unstable on fast drops, sensitive to wind). The new gains have been entered into conf_stabilisation_copter.h and should be verified on all vehicles.

Step 1: new Rate controller gains:
Roll/Pitch Rate:
P-gain 0.14  (old: 0.08)
I-Pre  0.5
I-Post 1.0
D      0.1   (old: 0.2)

Yaw: P 0.6 (old 0.5)
I-Pre  0.5
I-Post 0.5
D      0.0   

Step 2: new attitude gain (uprighting)
Roll/Pitch 
P-gain 2.0 (old 1.5)
all others 0.0

Step 3: new velocity gains to prevent drift in wind (adding integrator)
