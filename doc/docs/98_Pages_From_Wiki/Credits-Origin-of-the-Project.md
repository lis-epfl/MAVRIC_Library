# Origin of the Project
Those quad-copters have been developed for the MyCopter project, by Felix Schill and Nicolas Dousse, at EPFL Lausanne. 
MyCopter is a new project funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme to investigate enabling technologies for a personal aerial transportation system (PATS). More information can be found on the official project website. 

Their task was to have a flying platform to run outdoor experiments, demonstrating new collision avoidance algorithms, on real platform. A hardware-in-the-loop simulator and an emulator have been implemented to speed up the test process and scale-up the experiments.
