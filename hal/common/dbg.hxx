 * \brief   Write debug messages
 *
 * Prints human-readable messages to a console.
 * Before initialization, data is written to a dummy console.
 * dout() can be used for cout like syntax: 'dout() << "hello " << 123 << endl;'
 * To define '<<' operator for your own class, implement the follwing function
 * in the header of your class, outside of your class definition:
 * template<typename Writeable>
 *  Console<Writeable>& operator<< (Console<Writeable>& console, Yourclass& yourclass)
 *  {
 *      console.write(...);
 *      return console;
 *  }
